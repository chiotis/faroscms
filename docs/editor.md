# The content editor

The screen of one entry (`Admin > a content type > an entry`) has a **Content** tab with the title, the web address, the main content and an excerpt, a side card to publish (status, language, template, date, author, visibility) and a card for the title area; and the other tabs: the type's details, Blocks, Media, Taxonomies, Custom Fields, SEO (with a preview of the search result), Translations, History and Advanced (the front matter).

## The main content: visual over Markdown

The text of an entry is **Markdown, always**. The file on disk, the History, the export and the `body` field the form posts are Markdown, whichever way the person writes it.

- **Visual** (the default) is an editor where text looks as it will on the site: a style menu (paragraph, headings 2 to 4, code block), bold, italic, strikethrough, code, links, bulleted and numbered lists, quotes, images (from the library or an address, with a description), tables (with *+ Row*, *+ Column* and their opposites), a divider, undo and redo. Typing `## `, `- `, `1. ` or `> ` at the start of a line makes a heading, a list or a quote; `---` and a fence of three backticks followed by Enter make a divider and a code block. Pasted text is reduced to what Markdown can say (Word and Google Docs formatting becomes bold, italic, headings and lists), and pasted Markdown is drawn as formatted text.
- **Markdown** is the plain text with a few buttons. The choice is remembered in the browser. If the visual editor cannot start, the Markdown is shown and nothing is lost.
- A person with the raw HTML capability also gets *underline* (written as `<u>`) and embeds and buttons (written as HTML). Raw HTML already in the text is shown as a grey **HTML** box that is not run in the admin and is kept character for character; edit it in Markdown mode.

### Why the file does not change under your hands

`VisualMarkdown` (`POST /admin/markdown-visual`, capability `content.manage`) draws the Markdown with the site's own Markdown settings, one top-level block at a time, together with the lines each block came from. `public/assets/js/admin-editor.js` keeps those lines:

- Nothing is written to the textarea until the person types or formats something. Opening an entry and leaving it never changes the file.
- A top-level block that is exactly as it was drawn is written back as the lines it came from. Only the blocks that were edited are written again (with `-` for bullets, `**` for bold, `---` for dividers, and so on), so the History shows the change and not a rewrite of the text.
- The definitions links refer to (`[1]: https://…`) are kept and written at the end. When the lines of the blocks do not account for all of the text, the editor writes everything again instead of trusting them.
- Raw HTML is kept verbatim, so the check that stops someone without the raw HTML capability from adding HTML (`HtmlGuard`) still recognises what was already in the file.
- A new line in a paragraph is a line break, as everywhere on the site.

**Links that open in a new tab.** The link box has *Open in a new tab*. In the Markdown it is written as an attribute after the link, `[text](https://example.org){target=_blank}`, and the site draws `target="_blank"` with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. It is the only attribute the site accepts that way (no classes, ids or event handlers), and braces that are not an attribute, such as `{name}`, stay as text. A line that is only `{.class}` or `{key=value}` is read as an attribute and not shown.

**A picture beside the text.** Click a picture: the bar has *In the text* (the usual), *Left* and *Right*. A picture on the left or right floats to that side and the text goes around it; on a phone it takes the width of the page. In the Markdown it is an attribute after the picture, `![A cat](/uploads/media/cat.jpg){align=left}` (or `right`), and the site draws it with the `align` attribute of the image (the theme styles it). A picture pasted from WordPress or Word with a float or an `alignleft` class is written the same way. A picture that stands alone in a paragraph has its text in the paragraphs that follow, so for text to go around it put the picture at the start of the paragraph that should wrap.

**Text alignment.** The four alignment buttons (left, center, right, justify) align the paragraphs and headings the selection touches; left is the usual and takes the choice away. In the Markdown it is a line before the block, `{align=center}` then the paragraph or the `## heading`, and the site draws it with the `align` attribute (the theme styles it). It is for paragraphs and headings, not for list items, table cells or code. In Markdown mode you can type the line yourself; `align` is the only attribute of a block that is accepted besides `target` on a link.

**Pictures.** The Image button asks for an address and a description, or *Library…* to choose from the media library; the choice fills the address (and the description, when the picture has one) and *Insert* puts it in the text. **Removing or changing a picture:** click it. It is outlined and a small bar appears with *Edit* (the address and the description, with *Library…* and *Remove picture* in the same form) and *Remove picture*. Delete or Backspace removes a picked picture too, Escape or a click elsewhere lets it go. A paragraph that held only the picture goes with it, and so does a link that held only the picture.

~~Strikethrough~~ is part of the site's Markdown (the Strike button writes `~~text~~`).

## The live preview

The **Preview** button in the header of the editor shows the page beside the form, drawn by the theme from what is in the form now: the blocks, the front matter, the title, the template and the Markdown text. Nothing is saved and no version is written. The panel updates about 600 ms after the last change (typing, and every change of the Blocks tab: add, remove, move, a field, a design setting) and keeps its scroll position.

- **Show and hide**: the button (it says `aria-expanded`) shows and hides the panel; the choice is remembered in the browser. Hidden, the form has the whole width.
- **Computer, Tablet and Phone** widths and **Auto, Light and Dark** are the ones of the Theme preview. The panel is resized by dragging the handle on its left edge, or with the left and right arrow keys while the handle has focus (Shift for bigger steps); the width is remembered. Below 1200 px the panel is a drawer over the form (Close or Escape hides it) and never opens by itself.
- **Block to block**: a click on a block in the picture opens that block in the Blocks tab; a click on a block's header in the builder scrolls the picture to it and outlines it for a moment. Links and buttons in the picture are not followed. Blocks are told apart by their place in the editor's list (`data-bk-block` in the picture, the order of the cards in the builder), which is only added in the preview; the public page has no such marks.
- **Who and how**: `POST /admin/edit?preview=entry` with the whole form (the CSRF token included), for anyone who may edit that type (forms are not previewed). The server reads the form exactly as Save does (`ContentEditor::save(…, $dryRun = true)`), so an editor without the raw HTML capability sees raw HTML as plain text, as Save would keep it; it then draws the page through the public route (`ContentRepository::showInstead()` puts the unsaved entry in place of the stored one for that request). It answers `{html, path}`, or `{error}` when the front matter cannot be read; the panel then keeps the last picture. Files chosen in the form (a main image) are not in the preview until they are saved.
- The builder tells the page about every change with a `bk:change` event on `document`; the preview needs nothing else from how the builder draws blocks.

## Reordering blocks and rows

Blocks, the rows of a list inside a block (items, slides, columns, FAQ entries) and the short texts of an inline list are reordered by dragging, with no up and down buttons. `public/assets/js/admin-sortable.js` is the one module for it (no library; pointer events, so a mouse, a finger and a pen all work, in Safari too); `admin-blocks.js` uses it three times.

- **Mouse and pen**: drag the grip (six dots) at the start of a block's header, or anywhere on the header of a *collapsed* block or row, except on a field, a link or a button other than its title. **Touch**: drag the grip; the rest of the row still scrolls the page. A copy of the header is lifted under the pointer, the block stays in place dimmed, and a blue line shows where it will land (a vertical line between blocks that share a row). Near the top or bottom edge of the editor or of the window it scrolls by itself. Escape cancels.
- **Keyboard and screen reader**: the grip is a button. Space or Enter picks the block up, the arrow keys (and Home and End) move it, Space or Enter drops it, Escape puts it back. Every step is said through a polite live region ("Block Text moved to position 3 of 7"). The block's *…* menu also has *Move to top* and *Move to bottom*.
- Dropping writes the same hidden inputs the arrows did, so the saved front matter has the same shape; `bk:change` is sent as for any change, so the preview refreshes. Blocks that share a row through their Width are still one flat list: dragging only changes the order, and each block keeps its width.
- A list with one item has no grip (except a block in a column of a container, which can still go to another column). A row cannot be dropped into another list: each repeater is a list of its own. Blocks and containers share one group (`blocks`): see *Containers* below.

**The module.** `AdminSortable.create({container, items, handle, surface, surfaceActive, ghost, label, group, onSort})`:

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `container`, `items` | The list element and the selector of its items. A list owns the items whose nearest list is itself, so lists can be nested. |
| `handle` | Selector of the grip button inside an item. |
| `surface`, `surfaceActive(item)` | Optional: part of an item that also starts a mouse or pen drag, and a test that lets an item refuse (an open block). Elements marked `data-drag-surface` (a title button) start a drag when moved, and keep their click when not. |
| `ghost` | Selector of the part of an item that is shown lifted (its header). |
| `label(item, index)` | What the screen reader says for an item. |
| `group` | Lists of one group exchange items; a list without a group is on its own. The pointer drops into the innermost list of the group under it that takes the item; an item cannot be dropped into itself. |
| `accept(item, fromList)` | Optional: `false` keeps an item out of this list (a column does not take a container). The list's own items always stay. |
| `listName(list)` | Optional: how a screen reader names the list in an announcement (`column 2 of 3 in container 1`, `the top level`). |
| `meta` | Optional: anything the caller wants back (`info.fromList.options.meta`, `info.toList.options.meta`). The builder puts a function there that gives the array of blocks the list stands for. |
| `onSort(info)` | Called once on the list the item lands in: `{item, from, to, fromList, toList, via}`. |

The module never moves anything in the page: the caller changes its data and draws the list again. A column of a container is a list of the group `blocks` (and so is the top level), and `onSort` receives both lists. With the pointer an item can be dropped on any list of the group that takes it; with the keyboard **Shift and the left or right arrow** carry the picked-up item to the previous or next list of the group (in page order, around the ends) and say where it is ("Block Text is now in column 2 of 3 in container 1, position 1 of 2"), then the arrow keys place it there. `AdminSortable.announce(text)` says something through the live region; `reorder`, `insertIndex`, `slotToIndex` and `lineBox` are its pure parts. `tests/js/sortable.test.js` runs the module and the builder in jsdom.

## Containers: rows with columns

A **container** is a row with one to six columns that hold blocks. It is the third entry of the block picker's *Add block* (a *Container* row with the layouts 50 / 50, 33 / 67, 67 / 33, 3 × 33, 25 / 50 / 25 and 4 × 25), a card in the list like a block, and it is stored in the front matter as `type: container` with `settings` and `columns` (each with `settings` and `blocks`); the format, every setting and how the theme draws it are in `docs/theming.md` (*Containers*). One level only: a container is never inside a column.

- **The card.** Closed it shows *Container*, how many columns and blocks. Open it has two tabs: **Columns** (the columns side by side, each with its blocks listed inside, an *Add block* button and, with more than one column, a remove button; a *+* at the end adds a column up to six) and **Design**. A narrow editor puts the columns one under another.
- **Design** is in groups: *Columns* (a stepper for the number, the six presets as chips with a small drawing), *Column n of m* (a chip for each column, then its width: Fill, Auto, Fraction, Percent or Fixed size with a unit, minimum and maximum width, align-self, where its content sits, order, padding, background, corners, and a closed *Advanced* part with grow, shrink and basis), *Direction and alignment* (direction, wrap, justify content, align items, align content), *Gaps* (column and row gap, from the theme's spacing steps), *Responsive* (a switch Desktop / Tablet / Phone and, for the one chosen, how the columns stack: stay in a row, wrap to 2, stack to 1, with a small drawing; on a phone also *reverse the order*) and *Container* (the background tone, a picture from the Library with an overlay, inner width, spacing, minimum height, anchor, CSS class, hide).
- **Drag and drop.** One sortable group holds the top-level list and every column. Containers move in the top-level list; blocks move within a column, between columns and containers, and in and out of a container to the top level. A container dropped on a column goes to the top level instead (`accept`). A column is the drop target as a whole, its empty area (*Drop blocks here*) included. **Keyboard:** the grip of a block or container picks it up (Space or Enter), the arrows move it, **Shift + left or right** carries it to the previous or next list (the top level, then each column of each container in page order), Space or Enter drops it, Escape cancels; every step is announced ("Block Text moved to column 2 of 3 in container 1, position 1 of 2.").
- **The "…" menu.** A top-level block has **Wrap in container** (a container of one column, in its place, with the block in it); a block in a column has **Move out of the container** (to the top level, right after it); a container has **Unwrap (blocks to the top level)**: its blocks go to the top level in order, column by column. Each is announced. Move to top and Move to bottom work inside the list the block is in.
- **Width of a block in a column is ignored** and not shown there (the column decides the room; the stored `width` is kept, so a block moved out gets its width back).
- **Removing a column** moves its blocks to the neighbouring column (the previous one, the next for the first), so no block is lost. *Remove* on a container has *Undo* as on a block.
- **Live preview.** Every change (a move, a setting, a column added) sends `bk:change`, so the preview follows. A click on a container or a block inside it in the preview opens that card (the preview marks them `data-bk-block="<container>.<column>.<block>"`; the cards of the builder are `data-block-path` in the same notation).
- **Where it works:** pages and posts, Theme > Footer Blocks, saved sections (*Save as section* keeps the whole container) and ready-made sections (a section with a container is not offered in a column).
- The tests: `tests/js/block-containers.test.js` (moves, keyboard, wrap and unwrap, columns, a save round trip), `tests/unit/block-containers.php` and `tests/http/block_containers_test.py`.
