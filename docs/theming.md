# Theming

FarosCMS has one all-purpose theme, `themes/default`. It grows over time: new blocks, header and footer variants, and page templates are added to it, and every site picks what it needs through settings. Sites are not meant to switch themes.

For step-by-step recipes (a new block, a page template, a brand colour, a content type) and the testing checklist, see [theme-developer-guide.md](theme-developer-guide.md). This page is the reference.

Two rules follow from that:

1. **Updates must never break a site.** The theme is replaced on every update, so anything a site stores or overrides has to keep working with newer theme versions.
2. **Site-specific work lives in `custom/`**, which updates never touch.

## Template lookup

Twig searches `custom/` first, then `themes/default/`, by the same relative path. The theme itself is also available as the `@theme` namespace, so an override can extend the original and change one block:

```twig
{% extends '@theme/templates/single-post.twig' %}
{% block content %}
  {{ parent() }}
  <aside>…</aside>
{% endblock %}
```

Prefer this to copying a whole file: a copied file stops receiving theme fixes.

Template hierarchy (first existing file wins):

| Page | Candidates |
|------|------------|
| Home page | `templates/home.twig` |
| Single item | front matter `template:` → `templates/single-<type singular>.twig` → `templates/single.twig` → `templates/<type>.twig` → `templates/page.twig` / `templates/post.twig` |
| Type archive | `templates/archive-<type>.twig` → `templates/archive-<singular>.twig` → `templates/<type>_archive.twig` → `templates/archive.twig` |
| Taxonomy term | `templates/archive-<taxonomy>-<term>.twig` → `templates/archive-<taxonomy>.twig` → `templates/archive.twig` |
| Search | `templates/search.twig` |
| Not found | `templates/404.twig` |

Front matter `template:` accepts `landing`, `landing.twig`, or `templates/landing.twig`.

## Settings schema

`theme.yaml` declares the settings sections and fields. The admin Theme tab is generated from it, and stored values are checked against it on every request:

- a missing value takes the field default, so new fields need no migration;
- an invalid stored value (unknown option, out-of-range number, unsafe colour or URL) falls back to the default;
- an invalid submitted value keeps the current value;
- keys the schema does not declare are kept, so hand-added options still reach templates.

Field types: `text`, `textarea`, `email`, `url`, `image`, `video` (a video address: the media library's videos, a YouTube or Vimeo link, or a file elsewhere), `file` (a file to download: the media library's files of any kind, or a file elsewhere), `color` (`hex: true` accepts only `#rgb` or `#rrggbb`, stored as `#rrggbb`), `number` (`min`, `max`; `blank: true` lets it be empty, meaning "not set"; `units: other_field` with `ranges: {'%': [10, 100], px: [40, 2000]}` keeps it inside the range of the unit chosen in that select field, and 100 % is stored as empty; `presets: [25, 50]` adds one-click chips in the block editor, and `needs_size: size_field` on any field shows it only while that size is narrower than its column), `decimal`, `select` (`options`), `toggle`. Common keys: `label`, `help`, `placeholder`, `default`, `span: full`, `hidden: true`, and `when: {other_field: value}` (or a list of values), which makes the block editor show the field only while the other has one of those values.

Colours accept `#hex`, `rgb()/hsl()`, `var(--token)`, or a colour name. URLs and images reject quotes, brackets, whitespace, and non-http schemes. Both end up in inline styles, which is why they are strict.

Templates read settings as `theme_settings.<section>.<field>`.

## Compatibility rules for theme changes

These rules keep existing sites working after an update:

- Add fields, options, variants, and blocks freely, always with a default that reproduces the current look.
- Never rename or remove a field, option value, block type, or block field that sites may have stored. Retire a field with `hidden: true`; keep rendering old option values.
- Keep template, component, and block names stable. `custom/` overrides refer to them by path.
- Keep translation keys stable. Sites override them in `custom/lang/`.
- When a real break is unavoidable, ship a migration that rewrites stored data, and note it in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Blocks

A page, post, or any content item can list blocks in its front matter. Without `blocks:` the item renders as before.

```yaml
blocks:
  - type: hero
    variant: split          # layout, from the block's variants
    tone: default           # default | muted | contrast | accent (background)
    spacing: default        # default | compact | spacious | none
    width: 50               # 25 | 33 | 50 | 66 | 75; left out for the whole width (100)
    anchor: intro           # optional id for in-page links (#intro)
    heading: Websites that work as hard as you do.
    actions:
      - { label: Start a project, url: contact }
  - type: content           # where the item's Markdown body appears
  - type: faq
    hidden: true            # kept, not shown
```

- The first block may be a `hero`; it then renders the page's `<h1>` and the template skips its own title header. All other block headings start at `<h2>`, and their items at `<h3>`.
- If the body has text and no `content` block places it, it appears right after an opening hero (or first).
- Unknown block types and invalid values are ignored; fields take their defaults.
- Links (`type: link`): a bare path (`contact`) is relative to the current language (`/en/contact` on English pages); `/path` is from the site root; full URLs, `#anchor`, `mailto:`, and `tel:` are used as given.

First block family:

| Block | Variants | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `hero` | split, centered, cover, steps, minimal | Up to 2 buttons and 3 highlights. Opening hero images load first (`fetchpriority=high`). The `steps` layout is the cover layout with up to four numbered steps (title and text) under the buttons (each can link somewhere), like Features > Numbered steps. The picture can be a **video** instead of an image (Picture > Video): a file from the media library (`.mp4`, `.webm`), a file on another site, or a YouTube or Vimeo link. It plays silently, in a loop, behind the text of the cover and steps layouts and in the frame of the split and centered ones, with a pause button, a still image under it (and when a visitor's device asks for less motion or less data, where it starts only on request), and it rests while off screen. YouTube and Vimeo are put in a frame by the page's script after it has loaded (YouTube through youtube-nocookie.com, Vimeo in its background mode), so a page asks nothing of them until then; a video file is a plain `<video>`. |
| `content` | narrow, wide | The item's Markdown body. |
| `text` | default, split, lead, contents | Markdown text with optional buttons. `contents` puts a list of links made from the text's `##` headings beside it (headings get addresses), for terms, privacy pages and long guides; with fewer than two headings there is no list. |
| `text-image` | image-right, image-left, image-top, image-bottom | Bullet lists show check marks. Image shape: landscape, wide (16:9), portrait, square. With the image above or below the text, the picture runs across the whole width (no taller than 34rem) and the text keeps a readable measure. |
| `features` | cards, plain, numbered | Icon, title, text, and link per item; 2–4 columns. Services use the same block. |
| `stats` | row, cards | Numbers in a `<dl>`. |
| `testimonials` | grid, featured | `<figure>`/`<blockquote>`; initials when there is no photo. |
| `logos` | row, grid | Image logos or text wordmarks, spread over the whole width of the content however many there are (one row up to the most that fit; more in rows of the same length). `size`: the height of the logos, small (2.5 rem), medium (4 rem, the default), large or extra large; the taller they are the fewer fit in a row (7, 5, 4 or 3), and on a phone the heights are smaller. `colors`: black and white with colour on hover (the default), always black and white, or their own colours. |
| `columns` | image-side, image-top | Two or three columns side by side, each with a label, a heading (a link when it has an address), a picture, text and a link; stacks on a phone. |
| `faq` | stacked, split | Native `<details>`; adds `FAQPage` structured data. The page can open with all answers closed (default) or the first one open (`initial: first`, the same choice as the Accordion; the old `open_first: true` still works). |
| `accordion` | (one layout) | Compact `<details>` items for narrow columns, with titles one small step above the body text; no structured data (use `faq` for a page of questions). Options in the Design tab: several open at once (default on; off adds a small script and a shared `name`), chevron or plus/minus icon, lines or separate cards. The page can open with the first item open. The height change is animated by a small script and skipped when a visitor asks for less motion. |
| `cta` | band, card, split | Default tone: accent. |
| `cards` | grid, list | Latest items of a content type, or hand-written cards. |
| `form` | split, stacked | Any form from Admin > Forms. |
| `gallery` | grid, masonry, strip | Opens images in an accessible viewer (`<dialog>`, arrow keys, Escape); without JavaScript the images are plain links. |
| `team` | grid, compact | Photo or initials, role, bio, email and LinkedIn links. |
| `timeline` | vertical, alternating, steps | Ordered list of dated entries. |
| `contact` | split, cards | Contact details with icons and links, optionally beside a form. |
| `map` | contained, full, split | OpenStreetMap embed with marker, no API key. By default it loads only after the visitor clicks "Show map" (no third-party request on page load); links to OpenStreetMap and directions always work. With **Show** set to a content type (or everything with a place) it is a map of those entries with filters, search, a list and optional grouping of close markers (see `docs/places-and-routes.md`). |

Third block family (dynamic and interactive):

| Block | Variants | Notes |
|-------|----------|-------|
| `latest` | cards, list, compact, overlay, strip, featured, magazine, editorial | The newest posts, projects, or any content type, from a quiet text list to a magazine layout. Options: content type, an optional category or tag (`term`), number of items, columns, and toggles for images, excerpt, and date/category. It updates by itself, and renders nothing when there is nothing to show. `cards` (above) stays for hand-written cards. |
| `video` | featured, grid, split | YouTube, Vimeo, or a direct `.mp4`/`.webm` file. By default a video opens in a large viewer (`<dialog>`, Escape or backdrop to close, focus returns to the play button); `play: inline` plays in place. Nothing is requested from YouTube or Vimeo until the visitor plays (YouTube through `youtube-nocookie.com`, Vimeo with do-not-track), and no thumbnail is fetched, so give videos a preview image. Without JavaScript the play button is a link to the video's own page. Only YouTube, Vimeo, and video files are accepted. |
| `playlist` | grid, list, featured, strip | The videos of a YouTube playlist, drawn by the site from the playlist's public feed (15 newest videos) or, with a key in Settings > APIs, the YouTube Data API (up to 50, with lengths). The editor chooses the layout (grid with 2 to 4 columns, list with descriptions, a player with the list beside it, a scrolling strip), the order, how many, what to show (description, length, views, date, numbers), the picture shape, how a video plays (viewer, in place, or on YouTube), and a link to the playlist. Pictures are kept on this site by default. It shares the picture, play button and viewer of `video`. See `docs/youtube-playlist.md`. |
| `hero-slider` | default | Slides that each are a Hero (it replaces the Slider block of before 0.1.110: a page saved with that block is shown and saved as a Hero slider): every slide picks its own hero layout (split, centered, cover, centered cover, steps, centered steps, minimal) and has everything a hero has - eyebrow, heading, text, two buttons with a style, three highlights, up to four steps, and an image or a video behind the text. The markup and styles are the hero's (`components/hero-content.twig`, `blocks/hero`), so a slide looks as the hero does on a phone too; the slider's script adds previous/next buttons, dots and arrow keys, and optional automatic movement (off by default, with a pause button). Arrows and dots go below or over the slides. When the block opens the page, the header can sit over it like over an opening hero (transparent header), and it turns light or dark with the slide that shows. |
| `compare` | lines, striped | Comparison table: up to four columns (one can be highlighted, with a badge and a button) and up to 30 rows, some of them group headings. A cell that says `yes` or `no` (`ναι`, `όχι`) shows a check or a cross with text for screen readers; anything else is text. A real `<table>` in a focusable, named, scrolling region. |
| `before-after` | slider, side | Two pictures of one subject. `slider` lays them over each other with a handle (a native range input, so mouse, touch, and arrow keys work; without JavaScript they sit side by side). `side` shows them side by side. Labels, shape (4:3, 16:9, 4:5, square), and a caption are editable. |
| `pricing` | cards, list | Plans with badge, price, period, an "Included" list (one per line), and a button; one plan can be highlighted. `list` suits price lists. **Monthly / yearly switch** (`billing_switch`): each plan can have a `yearly_price` and `yearly_period` ("per year" when empty); the switch, with an optional note such as "Save 20%" on the yearly button, is shown by the page's script, and without JavaScript a plan shows both prices. A plan with no yearly price is the same either way. |
| `tabs` | horizontal, vertical | WAI-ARIA tabs (arrow keys, Home, End). Without JavaScript every panel is shown one after another. |
| `banner` | strip, callout | An announcement with an icon and a link. It can be dismissible; the choice is remembered in the visitor's browser for 30 days and resets when the text changes. |
| `image` | wide, narrow, full | One picture with a caption and an optional link (which can open in a new tab). The shape is Original, 16:9, 4:3, square, 4:5 or 21:9, with rounded corners or not; `full` runs edge to edge with the caption inside the page's margins. A block with no picture shows nothing. *Picture width* (Design tab) makes the picture narrower than its column: a percentage of the column (chips for 25 / 33 / 50 / 66 / 75 / 100 % or any value from 10 to 100) or a fixed size in pixels (40 to 2000, never wider than the column); the height follows, so nothing is cropped. Empty or 100 % is the whole column, as before, and is not written. A narrower picture is placed left, centered (the default) or right, the caption follows its width and position, and *Full width on a phone* (on by default) fills the column on a screen up to 640px. Stored as `image_width`, `image_width_unit` (`%` or `px`), `image_align` and `image_full_mobile`; the picture's `sizes` follow the width so a small picture does not load a large file. |
| `divider` | space, line, label | Space between sections (small to extra large), a rule (solid, dashed or dotted; page, text or short width) or a rule with a label. A space is hidden from screen readers. |
| `quote` | centered, bar, photo | One large quotation with a name, a role and (in `photo`) a picture. `<figure>` with a `<blockquote>`; the quotation mark is decoration. |
| `downloads` | list, cards | Documents to download. A row is a file picked from the media library (the **file** field), a title (the file name when empty), a short description, and a size (read from the file when it is one of the site's uploads, or typed). The kind of file is its extension. A file on another site opens in a new tab. A row with no file is hidden from visitors; someone who is signed in sees it dashed, saying why (so a ready-made page can be filled in). |
| `checklist` | plain, cards, split | Points marked with a tick or any icon of the set, each with an optional detail line; a point can be **not included** (a cross, muted, struck through, and announced as such). 1 to 3 columns. |
| `portfolio` | grid, overlay | A grid of work with **filter buttons** for the categories. Type the pieces in (title, categories separated by commas, picture, text, link) or show the entries of a content type, filtered by the categories they are filed under. The buttons are made of the categories in the order they first appear, are shown by the page's script, and do nothing to a page without it (everything shows). One category, or the switch off, means no buttons. |
| `table` | lines, striped, boxed | A data table. Column titles in one line, rows one to a line, cells divided by `\|` or by a tab (a range copied from a spreadsheet can be pasted as it is). `**bold**` and `[links](/address)` work in a cell, other markup is shown as text. A column that holds only figures (money, percentages, signs) is aligned to the right. Up to 100 rows and 12 columns; wide tables scroll inside a frame that the keyboard can reach. |
| `marquee` | text, logos | A band that scrolls by itself: big words with a dot between them, or logos (their names when there is no image). Slow, normal or fast, to the left or the right. It runs on CSS alone, stops while the mouse or the keyboard is on it, has a pause button, and for visitors who ask for less motion it is still and wraps. |

The blocks showcase page (`/blocks`, hidden, admins only) shows every block and variant.

### Block widths and rows

Every block has a **Width** in its Design tab (25, 33, 50, 66, 75 or 100%, stored as `width: 25|33|50|66|75`; 100 is the default and is never written, so content without widths renders exactly as before). It is one of the settings every block gets from `BlockRegistry`, not from `block.yaml`.

Blocks under 100% that follow each other are gathered by `BlockRenderer` into one `<div class="block-row space-…">` (plus `block-row--plain` when none has a background tone) and each section gets `block--w-25|33|50|66|75`. A 100% block, a hidden block excepted, ends the row. The row is a twelve-column grid as wide as a container (so it lines up with the standard, landing and sidebar templates) with the `--space-l` gap; a block takes 3, 4, 6, 8 or 9 columns (so a third is an exact third of the row minus the gaps) and wraps when the row is full. The row carries the vertical space of **one** section (the spacing of its first block); the blocks inside add none. Phone (up to 640px): every block is full width. Tablet (up to 960px): 25% and 33% become 50%, 66% and 75% become 100%. The block that opens the page (a hero or hero slider) is always full width, because the header, the title area and the page's `<h1>` belong to it. Heading levels do not change.

The styles are `assets/css/block-row.css` of the theme. They are added to the page's block stylesheet (`_blocks.css?b=…,_row`) **only when the page has a narrow block**, and there is no JavaScript. A theme that has no such file simply shows the blocks one under another.

A narrow block cannot use the layouts made for a full row, so `block-row.css` has a small set of rules for narrow blocks (a quarter, a third or a half of the row, and both on a tablet): side-by-side layouts (Text split, contents and image beside text, FAQ/Form/Map split, Hero split, Tabs vertical, Latest featured and editorial, Pricing list, Quote with photo, Video split, Playlist featured) and grids of items (Features, Gallery, Team, Latest, Cards, Video, Testimonials, Pricing) fall back to one column, or two in a half row on a desktop; the large headings come down a step; Logos show one per row in a quarter. A block with a background of its own (a tone other than default, a cover Hero, a Hero slider) becomes a **contained card** in its column (rounded, with padding), and a cover is only as tall as its content (minimum 24rem), not as tall as the screen. Blocks that already fit their column by width (Stats, Checklist, Downloads, Portfolio, Timeline steps) are left to adapt. When you write a block with a grid of its own that has fixed columns, add a rule for it in `block-row.css` (or your own `custom/` override of that file); in the CSS the narrow blocks are `.block-row > .block--w-25` and `.block--w-50`.

A block that had a field called `width` of its own (the Divider's line) names the new field in `block.yaml` (`width_moved_to: line_width`): a stored `width` that is not 25/33/50/66/75/100 is read as that field, so old content renders as before.

`scripts/theme-audit.js` has `themeAudit.rows(paths)` to check a page with rows at desktop, tablet and phone widths.

### Containers (rows with columns)

A **container** is an entry of `blocks:` that is not a block: a section with one to six columns, and blocks inside each column. It is what makes a layout the Width of a block cannot (a text beside a picture beside a form, a 25 / 50 / 25 row, a hero-like band with a picture behind the columns). Stored in the front matter, backward compatible (a page without one renders exactly as before):

```yaml
blocks:
  - type: container
    settings: {gap: l, justify: center}       # only what differs from the default
    columns:
      - settings: {width: 1/3, padding: m}
        blocks: [ {type: text, heading: One} ]
      - blocks: [ {type: image, image: /uploads/x.jpg}, {type: cta, heading: Go} ]
```

**One level only**: a container inside a column is dropped (stored pages are cleaned the same way, `scripts/check-blocks.php` and the skill's validator name it). `container` is a reserved name: `BlockRegistry` ignores a `blocks/container/` of a theme or of `custom/`. The shape (fields, checking, the classes and variables a column gets) is `src/BlockContainer.php`; the editor, `BlockRenderer`, `HtmlGuard`, the registry's storage check, `scripts/check-blocks.php`, `scripts/theme-audit.js` and the skill know it.

**Settings of the container** (all optional): `direction` (`row`, `row-reverse`), `justify` (justify-content: `start center end between around evenly`), `align` (align-items: `stretch start center end baseline`), `align_content` (align-content), `wrap` (`wrap nowrap wrap-reverse`), `gap` and `row_gap` (the theme's spacing steps `none xs s m l xl`, default `m`; never free sizes), `stack_desktop`, `stack_tablet`, `stack_phone` (how the columns stack on that screen: `row` stays in a row, `two` wraps to halves, `one` stacks to one column; tablet also has `auto`, the default: two columns stay in a row, more wrap to two; phone defaults to `one`), `reverse_phone` (reverse the order when stacked on a phone), `tone` (the section background, as a block's), `image` and `overlay` (`none light dark`; a picture behind the columns, decorative, with a dark overlay the section takes the `contrast` tone so the text is light), `inner` (`container`, `narrow`, `full` for the width of the content), `spacing` (as a block's), `min_height` (`none s m l screen`: 15, 25, 35 rem or the screen), `anchor`, `class` (letters, digits, `-` and `_`) and `hidden`.

**Settings of a column**: `width` (`fill`, the default, an equal share; `auto`, its content; a fraction `1/3`; a percentage `37%`; or a fixed size `20rem`, `320px`), `min_width`, `max_width`, `grow`, `shrink` and `basis` (when one is set the column is `flex: grow shrink basis` and the width is not used), `align_self` (`auto start center end stretch baseline`), `valign` (`top center bottom`: where the blocks sit in a column taller than they are), `order` (-6 to 6), `padding` (a spacing step), `tone` (the column's own background) and `radius` (`none s m l`). The columns of a row add up to exactly the row: the stylesheet takes the gaps off a fraction (`calc(100% * f - gap * (1 - f))`).

**Markup and styles.** `BlockRenderer` draws a container with the theme's `components/block-container.twig` (a `<section class="block block-container bkc tone-… space-…">`, an optional `.bkc-media` picture, `.bkc-inner`, the `.bkc-row` and a `.bkc-col` for each column; the blocks inside are the usual `components/block.twig` sections). Everything is a class (`bkc-j-center`, `bkc-gap-l`, `bkc-d-one`, `bkc-t-two`, `bkc-p-one`, `bkc-col--part`, `bkc-col--pad-m`…) or a custom property set inline and nothing else: `--bkc-f` (a part of the row), `--bkc-w`, `--bkc-min`, `--bkc-max`, `--bkc-grow`, `--bkc-shrink`, `--bkc-basis`, `--bkc-order`. The styles are `assets/css/block-container.css`, added to the page's block stylesheet (`_blocks.css?b=…,_row,_container`) **only when the page has a container**, together with the stylesheets of the block types inside the columns and with `block-row.css`, whose rules for narrow blocks also cover a block in a column (`:is(.block-row, .bkc-col) > .block`). No JavaScript. Stacking is by media query: desktop above 960px, tablet 641 to 960px, phone up to 640px. A theme without `components/block-container.twig` shows the blocks of the columns one under another: copy the file and the stylesheet from the default theme to give it containers.

**Width inside a column is ignored.** A block in a column takes the room of the column: its own Width is neither shown in the editor there nor used when drawing; instead `BlockRenderer` gives the block the narrow class that fits the column (a quarter, a third or a half: `block--w-25|33|50`, none for a wide column), so the narrow-block rules above apply and a Features grid, a Text split or a Form lay themselves out for the column. The stored `width` of a moved block is kept, so unwrapping a container gives the block its width back. Blocks inside a column have no vertical space of their own and are separated by `--space-l`; a column's blocks are sections, so headings stay `h2` and a block can never be the first block of the page (the page keeps its own title). A `content` block inside a column places the page's text.

**Live preview and the editor.** Each container and each block inside it carries `data-bk-block="<container>.<column>.<block>"` in the preview only, so a click in the preview opens the right card.

`themeAudit.containers(paths)` (`scripts/theme-audit.js`) checks a page with containers at desktop, tablet and phone widths: no column outside the container, a column set to stack to one fills the row, nothing wider than its column, no sideways scrolling.

### Writing a block

Create `blocks/<type>/` with three files:

- `block.yaml`: `label`, `description`, `variants`, optional default `tone` and `spacing`, and `fields` (FieldSchema types plus `markdown`, `link`, `repeater` with `fields`/`max`, `icon`, and `options_from: content_types | forms`).
- `preview.svg` (optional): the one-colour wireframe the editor's block picker shows beside the block's name. Draw it on a 64 by 48 grid with `fill="none" stroke="currentColor"` shapes (`rect`, `path`, `circle`, `line`, `polygon`; `fill="currentColor" fill-opacity=".14"` for tinted areas). Only those shapes and a few presentation attributes are kept; a block without one shows a placeholder.
- `variants/<layout>.svg` (optional): a drawing of each layout, in the format of `preview.svg`, shown as tiles in the Design tab where the layout is chosen (without them the layouts are plain buttons). `design_fields: [key, …]` in `block.yaml` moves fields of the block that change how a layout looks (the hero's `align`) to the Design tab, beside the layout; for such a field a drawing named `<layout>-<value>.svg` (`cover-center.svg`) is used while the field has that value. The hero has all of them. `variant_extends: {centred-cover: cover}` makes a layout a variant of another (its section also gets that one's class, so its styles apply), and `variant_migrations` (`when`, `to`, `drop`) moves blocks saved in a layout that has since become another (the hero's old text alignment is now two layouts).
- `block.twig`: receives `block` (checked values; Markdown fields also as `<key>_html`), `heading_tag`, `item_heading_tag`, `block_uid` (use `{{ block_uid }}-title` as the heading id), `block_first`, and the page context. Import `components/ui.twig` for `section_header`, `actions`, and `initials`.
- `block.css`: styles scoped to `.block-<type>`, using the tokens from `site.css`. It is loaded only on pages that use the block, bundled with the other blocks of the page into one request.
- `block.js` (optional): progressive enhancement only; the block must work without it. Loaded deferred and bundled the same way (`/_themes/default/_blocks.js?b=…`).

### Texts in several languages

A theme field of type `text` or `textarea` marked `translatable: true` can have a text for each language of the site. The Header and Footer tabs do this for the footer's summary, copyright, credits, address and hours, and the header's button text, top bar message and bottom bar link labels: while the site has more than one language, language chips appear on the card and every such text has a box for each language. It is stored as a plain text (the site's own language) or a map (`default` and a language code for each translation). In a template, `{{ value|localized }}` gives the text for the page's language, else the default, else the first there is; `components/header.twig` and `components/footer.twig` do it once at the top for their settings, so the rest of the file reads them as before. A text that is not marked stays one text for every language. The words the theme prints itself (Read more, Back to top, the headings of the footer's columns) are in Admin > Translations.

### Footer blocks

**Theme > Footer Blocks** holds blocks that show **above the footer on every page**, with **a set for each language** when the site has several (a language with no set of its own shows the site's own, and the editor offers a copy to start from): a row of logos, a call to action, a form (the footer has no call to action band of its own: use the CTA block). It is the same block editor as an entry's Blocks tab (without the whole-page layouts), and the blocks are stored in the theme settings (`footer_blocks`), not in a content file, as a list or as a map of `default` (the site's own language) and language codes (`src/FooterBlocks.php`). `footer_blocks()` in Twig gives `html`, `styles` and `scripts` for the current language, drawn once per request: `layouts/base.twig` asks for the styles and scripts in the head, and `components/footer.twig` puts the markup in a `.footer-blocks` wrapper before the `<footer>`. A site that overrides either file keeps the blocks by keeping those lines. Someone without the *Raw HTML in content* permission sees HTML they type as text, as in an entry.

### Editing blocks

Admin > Edit > **Blocks** lists the page's blocks: add (from a picker with each block's description), move, duplicate, hide, remove (with undo), and edit the fields generated from `block.yaml`, including repeaters and image fields with the media library. On save the server checks every value again (`BlockRegistry::sanitizeForStorage`) and stores only values that differ from the defaults. Unknown block types are kept unchanged. Without JavaScript the page's existing blocks are kept when it is saved.

## Content types

A content type is a folder in `content/` (`posts`, `projects`, or one you create). A **definition** adds two things: the fields an editor fills in, and how the type's archive page looks. Definitions are optional; a type without one behaves as before.

**The catalogue.** Every definition the theme ships is a ready-made type a site can have (today: posts, projects, books, points, routes, businesses). **Admin → Content types** shows every type as a card (its fields, entries and list layout, who defines it) with a switch for each ready-made type; pages (and forms, which belong to the CMS) are always on. A type that is off is hidden from the admin, the site, the sitemap and search, and its files are kept; switching it on again brings it back. A type counts as on when it is listed in the site settings (`content_types`) or already has files in its folder, unless it was switched off (`content_types_off`); an empty folder does not switch a prebuilt type on. To add a type to the catalogue, add `themes/<theme>/content-types/<type>.yaml` (and `templates/single-<singular>.twig` if its pages need their own layout). Types a site creates itself are not in the catalogue and are always on.

**Points of interest, Routes and Businesses** are ready-made too, for sites about places and tourist routes: a position on every entry, route files (GPX, KML, GeoJSON) with their length, climb and profile of the height, an archive layout that is a **map**, a **Map block** that shows them, and a page for each with a map and what is near. See `docs/places-and-routes.md`.

The **Books** type has the fields author, publisher, year, ISBN, language and a buy link, an archive of cards (A to Z, filtered by category), and its own page layout (`templates/single-book.twig`): the cover beside the title, author, summary (the excerpt), facts and buy button, then the text and blocks (Tabs suit reviews and editions).

Definitions live in `themes/default/content-types/<type>.yaml` (shipped with the theme) and `custom/content-types/<type>.yaml` (the site's own, kept across updates). When both exist they are merged: fields are added or changed one by one, and archive settings replace the theme's one by one. **Admin > Content types** edits the site file and writes only what differs from the theme, so theme improvements keep arriving. The editor of a type has a row for each field: a key that never changes, a label, a kind and, for a field you added, a help text and (for a select) its options, with the ways it is used (*Filter*, *Card*, *Page*, *Retired*) as chips. A field you added can be removed (the row is dimmed until you save, and *Undo* brings it back); the values already saved in content are kept.

```yaml
label: { el: Έργα, en: Projects }        # text, or a map per language
singular: { el: Έργο, en: Project }
fields:
  client:  { type: text, label: { el: Πελάτης, en: Client }, card: true }
  sector:
    type: select
    label: { el: Κλάδος, en: Sector }
    filterable: true                       # offered as a filter in the archive
    options: { '': '—', office: { el: Γραφεία, en: Office }, retail: Retail }
  year:    { type: number, label: Year, min: 1990, max: 2100 }
archive:
  layout: cards            # cards, list, compact, overlay, featured, magazine, editorial
  columns: '3'
  per_page: 12             # 0 shows everything on one page
  order: date_desc         # date_desc, date_asc, title_asc, title_desc, random, or field:<key>:asc|desc
  taxonomies: [categories] # taxonomies offered as filters
  show_image: true
  show_excerpt: true
  show_date: true
  show_meta: true          # category and card fields
```

- **Field types:** `text`, `textarea`, `markdown`, `email`, `url`, `link`, `image`, `color`, `number`, `decimal`, `date`, `select`, `toggle`. Per field: `card: true` shows it on the item's card, `show: false` hides it on the item's own page, `filterable: true` (select fields) adds an archive filter, `hidden: true` retires it. Repeaters are not available.
- **Storage:** values are saved in the item's front matter under `custom_fields`, checked against the definition on every read and write, so a stored value can never push markup into a template. Fields you declare get their own inputs in the editor (a "<Type> details" tab) and no longer appear under free-form Custom Fields.
- **Compatibility:** follow the same rules as theme settings. Never rename a field key, retire it with `hidden: true` instead (stored values are kept), and give a `select` a stable set of option values.
- **On the page:** every single page shows its declared fields as a fact sheet (`components/type-fields.twig`, included by `components/page-body.twig`). In templates, `content_fields(item)` returns the fields to print and `content_fields(item, 'card')` those marked for cards; `content_type('projects')` returns the definition.
- **Archive:** `templates/archive.twig` draws the list with the same eight layouts as the Latest content block (`components/entry-list.twig`). Filters are plain links and a `<form method="get">` (no JavaScript): `?filter[sector]=retail&page=2`. Filter values that no item has are never offered. Filtered pages are `noindex`; each page of a paginated listing has its own canonical URL. Category and tag pages use the same layout, with settings of their own per taxonomy (see below).
- **Taxonomies of the site's own:** **Admin > Taxonomies > New taxonomy** makes one (a name, an address, optionally the content types its pages list): `content/taxonomies/<name>.yaml`, the same file as categories and tags. Its terms have pages at `/<name>/<term>` (and `/en/<name>/<term>`), drawn by `templates/archive-<name>-<term>.twig` → `archive-<name>.twig` → `archive.twig`, titled "Name: Term", with the same layout settings (Theme > Archive Layouts) and hreflang links, and a term that changes address leaves a redirect behind. `/<name>` alone is an ordinary page address, so a page can be made there. The name cannot be a reserved word, a language, a content type, another taxonomy, the home page or a page; a content type cannot take the name of a taxonomy. Entries keep their terms in the field named like the taxonomy (`project-types: [web]`), the menu editor offers the terms, and the default single templates of posts and projects list them under the title; a template draws them with `item_terms(item, prefix)` (`[{name, title, terms: [{label, url}]}]`, for the taxonomies a site added) or `taxonomy_url('<name>', term, prefix)` and `taxonomy_label(...)`.
- **Taxonomy archives:** each taxonomy (categories, tags) has its own archive settings in `content/taxonomies/<name>.yaml` under `archive:`, edited in Admin > Theme > Archive Layouts. The keys are those of a content type's archive (`layout`, `columns`, `per_page`, `order`, `show_*`, `title`, `subtitle`, `taxonomies` for filters) plus `types: [posts, projects]` for the content types listed (none means all). `{term}` in `title` and `subtitle` is replaced by the term's name. A term can also have a description per language (Admin > Taxonomies): it is shown as the subtitle unless the taxonomy sets one, and templates receive it as `term_description`. Only what differs from the defaults is stored. The templates lookup is unchanged, so `archive-category.twig` or `archive-tag-<term>.twig` can still take over.

  **A tree of terms.** Categories are a tree by default (tags and a site's own taxonomies are not, unless `hierarchical: true` is in the file or *Terms can have a parent* is ticked in Admin > Taxonomies). A term has an optional `parent` (the id of another term). Its address holds its parents' slugs: `/category/books/english`, drawn by `archive-category-<own slug>.twig` → `archive-category.twig` → `archive.twig`. Moving a term or changing a parent's slug leaves redirects behind for the old address of the term and of every term below it, in every language, and updates menu links. The archive card of a tree has a *Sub-terms* chip (`include_children`, on by default): the page, the feed and the language links of a parent then also cover what is filed under its children. Deleting a parent moves its children up a level. The template receives `term_trail`, the parents above the term as `[{label, url}]`, and with *Breadcrumbs* on the trail is Home, the parents, the term.
- **Per-type templates** still work: `custom/templates/archive-<type>.twig` and `single-<type>.twig` win over the defaults.
- **Latest content block:** the block lists any type, so a new type is available in it straight away.

## Single layouts and archive layouts

**Admin > Theme > Single Layouts** has one card for each content type the site has (pages, posts, projects, forms, books, and any type added later gets its card by itself). A card sets, for the page of one entry of that type:

- the **page layout**: one of the page templates below (Standard, Landing, or one a site adds). A type whose own template is not the standard one (the book page, `single-book.twig`) has no page layout and no title area to style; its card says so and links to the fields of the type;
- the **title area**: Default, Centered, Split, Cover or Minimal (the same five as the Hero block), and whether the header sits over it (Site default, Over the title, Solid);
- what shows: the image, the excerpt, and for the templates that print a line above the title (posts and projects) the date and terms;
- the **sidebar**: None, Right or Left, whatever the page layout (a landing page has none). With one, the page uses the With sidebar template and the card says which parts it holds: contents, related pages, the contact card. The text of the card is the same for every type, in a panel below the cards.

**Parallax** (the *Effect* row of a card, off by default) makes the picture of a Default or Cover title area move at about a third of the speed of the page. `site.js` does it while the area is on screen (a `data-parallax` attribute starts it, `--parallax-y` moves the picture, which is made 15% taller above and below so no edge shows), and does nothing for people who ask for less motion or when scripts do not run. Centered and Split show the picture as a picture, so they keep it still. The choices are stored in the theme settings under `single_layouts.<type>`, so a type with no choice yet has the defaults. A site that saved the older Hero Layouts, Transparent Header and Sidebar settings starts from them. A single entry can still choose its own title area, header and parallax in its editor (`hero_layout`, `header_transparent`, `hero_parallax: on|off`), and its own page layout (`template:`; `standard` asks for the plain one when its type has another).

A theme declares what a card offers in its manifest:

```yaml
single_layouts:
  fields:
    title: {type: select, label: Title area, default: default, options: {default: Default, split: Split}}
    header: {type: select, label: Header, default: site, options: {site: Site default, 'on': Over the title, 'off': Solid}}
    # sidebar (none, right, left), image, excerpt, byline, toc, related, card
```

**Breadcrumbs** (the *Show* row, off by default) draw a trail above the title: Home, the list of the type, the entry. The same chip is on every archive card (*Show*, `breadcrumbs`): Home and the list, or the category or tag by its own title. `components/breadcrumbs.twig` draws it inside the title area (`crumbs` of `title-area.twig`: a list of `{label, url}`, the last one the page itself).

**A title area for a term.** In Admin > Taxonomies a term has a *Title area of its entries* (Default, Centered, Split, Cover, Minimal, or none): the entries filed under it open with it unless an entry chooses its own; an entry in several terms takes the first term (categories, then tags, then the site's own taxonomies) that has a choice, and an entry's own choice still wins. It is stored as `hero_layout:` on the term in `content/taxonomies/<name>.yaml`, and `components/hero-layout.twig` reads it with `term_hero_layout(item)`.

Templates read the choices of a type with `single_layout(type)` (a map of `template`, `title`, `header`, `sidebar`, `image`, `excerpt`, `breadcrumbs`, `byline`, `toc`, `related`, `card`). The page layout and the title area follow from the template files: `usesTitleArea` is true for a template that includes `components/page-header.twig`, and the line above the title is offered for one that passes `hero_meta`.

**Admin > Theme > Archive Layouts** has one card for each list of entries: every content type that has one, then each taxonomy (the pages of a category or tag). A card sets the layout (seven pictures to choose from), columns, order, items per page, the parts shown, the taxonomies offered as filters, the title and the subtitle, and the **title area** above the list: one of the five layouts of an entry's title area (`title_layout`: default, centered, split, cover, minimal), a picture for it (`title_image`, from the Library) and parallax (`title_parallax`) for the default and cover layouts, as in Single Layouts. A cover with no picture is the default one. `components/title-area.twig` draws it for entries (through `page-header.twig`) and for lists (`archive.twig`). The **Search** card (under *Other pages*) gives the search page the same title area, and its own title and subtitle for each language (`search_page` in the theme settings; without them the page says what the theme says, "Search" and its line in Admin > Translations); the search box sits inside the title area, in any layout (`hero_extra` of the component). A taxonomy also chooses which content types it lists. Only what differs from the theme's defaults is written, to `custom/content-types/<type>.yaml` and `content/taxonomies/<name>.yaml` as before. The Content types and Taxonomies screens link here instead of holding these settings.

### Options of a content type

A content type with a page or a list of its own can declare **options** in its definition (`themes/<theme>/content-types/<type>.yaml`, or `custom/content-types/<type>.yaml` for a type of the site's own, merged one by one with the theme's). They appear on the type's card in Theme > Single Layouts and Archive Layouts, so every special type brings its own choices to the one place where looks are set:

```yaml
single:
  sidebar: true        # its template draws a sidebar when the card asks (None, Right, Left): the card offers the choice
  header: true         # its template opens with a section the header can sit over: the card offers the choice
  options:             # options of its page: key => definition (select, toggle, number, decimal, text, color)
    cover: {type: select, label: Cover, default: left, options: {left: Left, right: Right, top: Above}}
    show_buy: {type: toggle, label: Buy button, default: true}
archive_options:       # options of its list
  cover_shape: {type: select, label: Covers, default: portrait, options: {portrait: Portrait, square: Square}}
```

Values are checked against the declaration: a page's are stored with the theme settings (`single_layouts.<type>.options`) and read in the template with `single_layout(item.type).options`; a list's are stored in the site's file of the type (`archive.options`, only what differs from the theme's) and read as `archive.settings.options`. The default archive template also adds a class for each (`opt-cover-shape-portrait` for a choice, `opt-some-toggle` for a toggle that is on) to the list, for the style sheet. A template that declares `sidebar: true` draws the sidebar itself (as `templates/sidebar.twig` does), and one that declares `header: true` sets `{% set opens_under_header = true %}` so the layout lets the header go transparent over its first section. The Books type (`single-book.twig`) is the example: where the cover goes, what shows (author, summary, details, buy button), a sidebar, a header over the book, and the shape of the covers in the list.

## Page templates

Pages and posts choose a template in Admin > Edit > Publish (stored as `template:`), and a content type can have one as its layout (Theme > Single Layouts). The manifest's `page_templates` lists them; a template appears only if its file exists.

- **Standard** (`default`): the normal hierarchy: title header, text, blocks.
- **Landing** (`landing`): no title header; the page is its blocks. Without an opening hero the title is still the (visually hidden) `<h1>`.
- **With sidebar** (`sidebar`): title header, then the text beside a sticky sidebar with "On this page" contents (from the text's `##` headings, which get ids), the related pages from the main-menu branch the page belongs to, and a card from Theme settings > Single Layouts > Sidebar card (text, button, phone and email). Blocks follow below at full width; a Page content block does not repeat the text.

Add a template by creating `templates/<name>.twig` and listing it under `page_templates` in the theme manifest. A site adds its own the same way without touching the theme: put `custom/templates/<name>.twig` next to a `custom/page-templates.yaml` (`name: {label: …, description: …}`); both are kept across updates.

## Ready-made sections

In the block editor, **Add block** has three tabs: single blocks, **Ready-made sections** (a few blocks that belong together, e.g. FAQ + call to action), and **Page layouts** (a whole page, optionally with a suggested template). A page layout can replace the page's blocks (with undo) or be added after them.

Presets are YAML files in `themes/default/presets/` (theme) and `custom/presets/` (site):

```yaml
kind: section            # or page
template: landing        # page layouts only, optional
label: { el: 'Ομάδα', en: 'The team' }
description: { el: '…', en: '…' }
blocks:
  el: [ { type: team, heading: 'Η ομάδα', members: [ … ] } ]
  en: [ { type: team, heading: 'The team', members: [ … ] } ]
```

Labels, descriptions, and blocks may be a single value or a map per language; the editor uses the page's language, then the default language. Theme presets hold placeholder text and no images, so they work on any site.

The theme ships these page layouts (all in Greek and English, with placeholder text and no pictures): **Home**, **About**, **Contact**, **Service page**, **Campaign landing page**, and, for the second family of blocks, **Lead generation landing** (Landing template), **Pricing page**, **Work index (portfolio)**, **Case study**, **Careers**, **Blog home (magazine)**, **FAQ and help center**, **Resources and downloads**, **Event or webinar** (Landing template), **Services overview**, **Legal page** (text with a contents list), **Coming soon** (Landing template) and **Link in bio** (Landing template).

Editors can tick blocks and **Save as section**: the blocks are checked and written to `custom/presets/<name>.yaml` in the page's language, appear under Ready-made sections with a delete button, and are included in backups (Site customizations).

## Header and footer

**Admin > Theme > Header** and **Footer** have the real site beside them (it follows what is chosen, before it is saved), the layouts to choose from, and a few small cards. Everything is a solid colour. The frame shows the page at a computer, tablet or phone width, in light or dark; because a header or footer choice changes what the page is made of, the server draws the page with the unsaved settings (`POST /admin/theme?preview=page`; nothing is stored and no form is processed) and the frame shows that, keeping its scroll and following links inside it.

Header:

- **Layout**: *classic* (logo left, menu right), *menu left* (logo and menu together on the left, tools on the right), *split* (menu left, logo in the middle, tools right), *centered* (logo in the middle, menu below), *stacked* (menu in a full-width bar underneath, with a background of its own; the page you are on is highlighted, a palette can set `--bar-highlight`), *minimal* (logo and a menu button on all screens) and *minimal centered* (the button on the left, the logo in the middle).
- **Style**: *shape* (full width bar or floating, detached from the edges with rounded corners), *content width* (contained or edge to edge), *height* (regular, compact, tall), *edge* (a line, nothing, a shadow), *background* of the row with the logo (page, muted, soft tint, a **fade** from the muted colour or the soft tint into the page background, dark, palette colour; a fixed header or one over a hero is a plain tint or clear), *menu links* (soft background on hover, underline, plain).
- **Behaviour**: *sticky* (slides in after scrolling, always at the top, **smart** (leaves while the page is read downwards and returns when it is scrolled back up), or scrolls away), *shrinks* once the page is scrolled, and **transparent over an opening hero** (on pages that start with a Hero block, or a Slider block of full width, the header overlays it, with light text over a cover image or dark hero, and turns solid when the page scrolls; a content type or an entry can decide otherwise, see Single layouts).
- **Elements**: *search* (an icon, a box, or none), the *language switcher* and the *dark mode switch* (each can be turned off), and a **button** (text, link, solid or outline) in the header and the phone menu.
- **Top bar**: a message (optionally a link), the phone and email (from the Footer), the social icons, on a muted, dark or palette background; it shows when it has any of them.
- **Phone**: how the menu opens (side drawer from the left or right, full screen, sheet from the top or bottom), and the bottom bar (menu, call, email, the button, or links of your own with icons).

Footer:

- **Layout**: *columns* (brand and summary, the footer menu, contact), *mega* (a column for each top-level link of the footer menu that has links under it; the links with none share the first column), *one row*, *bar* (the copyright on the left, the links on the right, thin lines between them) and *centered*.
- **Background**: dark (the base), the page's, muted, or the palette colour; a colour or an image of your own replaces it. **Brand**: the site name, the logo, or nothing.
- **Content**: the summary, the copyright line (`{year}`, `{site}` and `{copyright}`, the © sign, are filled in), a credits line under it (for example *Designed by [Unicorg](https://…)*; links are written `[text](address)`, and the same three words work), email, phone, address and opening hours, the **links at the bottom** (a menu given the place *Footer bottom links*), the social icons, a language switcher and a back to top link.

A site-specific block goes in `custom/blocks/<type>/` with the same files.

## Branding

**Admin > Theme > Branding** gathers everything that makes up the look of the site, for a designer: the theme's `appearance`, `brand` and `design` sections in one tab (a theme that declares `design` gets this tab; otherwise each section is its own tab). Cards on the left, the real site on the right: the frame shows the home page with the unsaved choices as they are made, at computer, tablet or phone width and in light or dark (the browser asks `POST /admin/theme?preview=branding`, which answers with the CSS and attributes and stores nothing; the same frame serves the Header and Footer tabs).

**Site / Style samples** switches between the real page and a specimen of H1–H6, paragraphs, links, buttons, a card, form fields, and accent and dark panels. Both follow the unsaved choices and keep the site's custom CSS after the branding rules. The specimen is fetched from the protected `GET /admin/theme?preview=styles` and drawn in the frame; it is not site content and stores nothing. The size controls change only the preview width, not the settings being edited.

- **Identity** (`brand`): the logo, a **logo for dark backgrounds** (shown in dark mode, in a dark or palette footer, in a dark or palette header row, and over a dark opening hero; without it the logo is used everywhere), the site name beside the logo, heights of the logo (computer, phone, footer) and the size of the name, the **favicon**, the **app icon** (`apple-touch-icon`), the **browser colour** (`theme-color`) and the default share image.
- **Colour**: the palette and the mode (`appearance`), and **your own colours** for light and for dark: accent, background, surface, text, muted text border and an optional **secondary** colour, and the near-black of dark panels and the footer. Above them are the **site palettes** and the contrast panel (below). The hover and soft shades of the accent, the second shade of the surface and the border, and a readable text colour on the accent (white or the theme's near-black) are worked out from the ones given.
- **Typography**: the font pairing (`appearance`), a family for headings and one for text (thirteen system stacks, so nothing is downloaded, or **your own WOFF2 file** from `custom/assets/fonts/`), text size, line height, a **heading scale** (a ratio from 1.125 to 1.618, gentler on a phone), heading weight, letter spacing, line height and capitals.
- **Layout and spacing**: content width, reading width, side margin, space between sections, **header height** (compact and tall follow it), and a spacing scale.
- **Shape and depth**: corners (`appearance`), a **radius in pixels**, shadows, decoration.
- **Buttons**: height, side padding, text size, weight, capitals, button corners.

### Site palettes, the generator and Duo

The seven ready-made palettes are not the only choice. **Site palettes** are palettes made on this site, kept next to the ready-made ones as chips (several are allowed; each can be renamed and deleted). A site palette holds the six colour roles for light and for dark (see "The colour roles" in the developer guide), the near-black of dark panels (`ink`) and an optional `secondary`. Stored as JSON in `design.site_palettes`, the one in use is `design.site_palette` (its id). Choosing a ready-made palette puts the site palette aside; the ready-made one underneath still supplies whatever the site palette leaves out.

- **From two colours** (*New from two colours*): give an **accent** and a **base**, say whether the base is the **background** or the **ink** (the text colour), and swap them with the arrows if needed. `PaletteGenerator` works in OKLCH, so the tints and shades of the neutrals step evenly, and derives both modes: surface, border, text, muted text, the accent for each mode, the dark panel colour and, with a third colour, the secondary. A base that is clearly light (or clearly dark) is used as the light (or dark) background as it is; a mid-tone only lends its hue. The result is deterministic, and **always AA**: text and muted text reach 4.5:1 on the background and on the surface, the accent reaches 4.5:1 as text on both, and the text colour Branding puts on the accent (white or the near-black) reaches 4.5:1 on it. The accent (and secondary) is moved along lightness, keeping its hue and chroma, only as far as that takes, so a bright brand colour gets a deeper light-mode accent and the original dark-mode one. The live preview follows every change; *Save palette* names it and keeps it in the form (stored with Save changes).
- **Fine-tune role by role**: choose a site palette to edit its colours in a small table, each with its contrast badge; *Make again from two colours* reopens the generator with the colours it was made from. Colours set under *Your own colours* still win over the palette.
- **Colour pairings from Duo** (Alex Pate, duo.alexpate.com): a collection of 103 colour pairs. It has **no licence, so none of it is in this code**. When the picker is opened the server fetches `https://duo.alexpate.com/colors.json` (`DuoPairings`: a few seconds' timeout, https only, a small answer only), keeps the answer in `storage/cache/duo-pairings.json` for 7 days and shows the pairs as swatches with an *Only AA pairs* switch (Duo's own flag) and our own contrast badge. Picking a pair fills the generator (first colour accent, second base). If the request fails the picker is replaced by a quiet note and nothing else changes. *Colour pairings settings* has the address (`design.duo_url`, empty means Duo's) and a switch (`design.duo_picker`) to turn the picker off. The credit *Colour pairings from Duo by Alex Pate* links to duo.alexpate.com. The public site never contacts Duo.
- **Update safety**: nothing is added to a page until a site palette is in use, or a secondary colour is set; palettes that are stored but not in use add nothing.

### Contrast feedback

Under the colour controls, the **Contrast** panel reads the colours the preview actually has, in light and dark: text on background, text on surface, muted text, the text on the accent, links (the accent on the background) and, when set, the secondary. Each shows the two colours (so a colour inherited from the palette appears as the colour it gets), the ratio and a badge: **AAA** (7:1 or more), **AA** (4.5:1), **Large text only** (3:1) or **Fails AA**. The generator, the site palette table and the Duo swatches carry the same badges (`Contrast`, the same rules as WCAG 2).

### The secondary colour

*Branding > Colour > Secondary (optional)*, `design.light_secondary` and `design.dark_secondary`, gives a second brand colour. Nothing is output until one is set; a mode left empty uses the other mode's colour. The variables, for theme developers and blocks (the default blocks do not use them yet): `--color-secondary`, `--color-secondary-hover`, `--color-secondary-soft` and `--color-secondary-contrast` follow the colour mode like `--accent`; `--secondary-l`, `--secondary-l-hover`, `--secondary-l-soft`, `--secondary-contrast-l` and the `-d` set are the fixed ones for each mode. Read them with a fallback: `var(--color-secondary, var(--accent))`.

**Headings in colour** (Branding > Colour): *Heading colour* is the colour of the text (the usual), the palette colour (the accent, following the mode), or colours of your own for light and dark (the *Headings* row). It colours the headings of the text, section titles and the title of a page or a list; dark panels, the footer and headings over pictures keep their own colour. The token is `--heading-color`.

Fields show **Theme value** when they match the schema default and **Your value** when they override it. Empty colour fields show the inherited swatch and hex code without storing that colour. A field's **Reset** restores its schema default; **Reset … overrides** resets the group's design fields while keeping the selected palette, font pairing and corners. Resets update the preview immediately and take effect on the site only after Save.

For the bundled default theme without Custom CSS, button weight shows **Semi** and inherited button corners show **Pill** with the Soft and Rounded shape presets. These are still stored as `auto` until you explicitly choose a value, including clicking the selected choice; Reset restores `auto`. With Sharp, **From shape** preserves the theme's 4 px radius because none of the fixed choices matches it. Changing the shape never replaces an explicit button radius. Inherited spacing is labelled **Normal**, shadows **Soft**, varied heading defaults **By element**, and responsive heading sizes **Theme scale**. Other themes, sites with Custom CSS, and browsers without JavaScript retain an explicit inheritance choice. No stored values or public styles are migrated.

Every `design` field is optional: empty, or "Theme", leaves the theme's own value, so a site that sets nothing looks as it did. `Branding::css()` (`src/Branding.php`; a site palette in use first fills the colours the site has not set, `SitePalettes::apply()`) turns the choices into one rule on `:root[data-theme][data-mode]` (which beats the palette, font, shape and mode rules) plus a few element rules; the layout prints it in `<style id="faros-branding">` after the theme's style sheet and before `custom.css`, with `{{ branding_css()|raw }}` and `{{ branding_head() }}` (the icons, the browser colour and a hint to fetch a font file). It is made only of numbers, hex colours and words from fixed lists, so nothing a person types can reach the style sheet as code. The tokens it sets: `--accent-l*`, `--accent-d*`, `--accent-contrast-l/d`, `--color-secondary*` and `--secondary-*` (only when a secondary colour is set), `--n-*`, `--d-*`, `--ink*`, `--font-heading`, `--font-body`, `--type-scale`, `--step-1` to `--step-5`, `--heading-weight`, `--heading-tracking`, `--heading-color`, `--container`, `--container-narrow`, `--gutter`, `--section-scale`, `--space-scale`, `--header-min`, `--radius-*`, `--radius-button`, `--shadow-*`, `--btn-height`, `--btn-pad-x`, `--btn-size`, `--btn-weight`, `--btn-case`, `--btn-tracking`, `--logo-height`, `--logo-height-mobile`, `--footer-logo-height`, `--brand-name-size`; a theme's own CSS should read them with a fallback (`var(--btn-height, 2.875rem)`).

Optional component tokens carry explicit typography choices into prose, hero titles and other component headings: `--body-leading`, `--heading-leading`, `--heading-font-custom`, `--heading-weight-custom`, `--heading-tracking-custom`, and `--hero-title-size`. Components keep their existing fallbacks when those choices are unset. `--accent-band-bg` pairs a custom light accent with its calculated text colour on Slate's accent panels; without an override, Slate keeps its original dark background.

## Design tokens

`site.css` defines semantic tokens (`--color-bg`, `--color-surface`, `--color-text`, `--color-muted`, `--color-border`, `--accent`, `--accent-soft`, `--accent-contrast`, spacing `--space-*`, type scale `--step-*`, radii `--radius-*`). Theme settings switch them through attributes on `<html>`:

- `data-glow`: `solid` removes the decorative glows (Branding > Shape and depth > Decoration);
- `data-theme`: palette (slate, indigo, emerald, teal, rose, amber, garnet), with light and dark variants of each accent;
- `data-mode` and the `.dark` class: colour mode, following the system until the visitor chooses;
- `data-font`: sans (Inter), display (serif headings with Inter text), serif, or system (no font download);
- `data-shape`: soft, rounded, or sharp corners.

Block tones re-scope the same tokens, so every component works on every background. Text and accent pairs meet WCAG AA contrast in all palettes, in light and dark mode.

## Fonts

Inter ships with the theme (`assets/fonts/inter/`, SIL Open Font License) as a variable font (weights 300–800) split into Latin, Latin Extended, Greek, and Greek Extended files. `unicode-range` makes a page download only the files its text needs, and the layout preloads Latin (and Greek on Greek pages). Nothing is loaded from Google or another third party. A site that wants no web font chooses "System fonts" in Theme settings.

## Images

`image(src, options)` renders responsive markup for files in `/uploads`:

- intrinsic `width`/`height` (no layout shift);
- a WebP `srcset` (360–2400 px) with the original as fallback;
- `loading="lazy"` by default, `priority: true` for above-the-fold images (eager, `fetchpriority=high`);
- `alt`: the given text, `''` for decorative images, or the media library's alt text when omitted.

Variants are created on first request at `/uploads/_v/<file>/<width>-<version>.webp` and then served as static files. The version comes from the source file's modification time, so replacing a file changes its URLs. Variants are excluded from backups and removed when the media item is deleted. Alt text is edited in Admin > Media.

## SEO

The layout outputs the title (`Page | Site`, or the SEO title), meta description, canonical URL, `hreflang` alternates, Open Graph (`og:type`, `og:site_name`, `og:locale` and alternates, image), and Twitter card tags. The share image falls back from the SEO image to the main image, the first block image, and finally Theme > Branding > Identity.

Structured data is one JSON-LD graph per page:

- `Organization` everywhere: name, logo, social profiles (`sameAs`) and, when the Footer has a phone or an email, a `ContactPoint`.
- `WebSite` on the home page of each language, with a `SearchAction` that points at that language's search page.
- `BlogPosting` for a post and `Article` for a project: headline (cut at 110 characters), address, language, publisher, the author (the person named in the editor, otherwise the organization), `datePublished` and `dateModified`, the summary, and a picture (the entry's main image, then its SEO share image, then the first picture in its blocks, then the site's default share image, as a full address).
- `WebPage` for every other page, pointing at the site.
- `BreadcrumbList` on inner pages, and `FAQPage` from FAQ blocks.

Text is escaped so nothing typed in the admin can end the script tag. Templates can add nodes through the `structured_data` variable or override `{% block structured_data %}`.

## Accessibility

- Skip link to `<main id="main">`, visible focus styles, and `prefers-reduced-motion` support.
- One `<h1>` per page and no skipped heading levels (blocks and cards pick their level from the page).
- Mobile menu: a dialog with `aria-expanded`, focus moved in, kept in, and returned on close; Escape closes it.
- Cards and feature items have one link each (the title), stretched over the item.
- Forms: a field can take a half, a third or two thirds of the row (`field.width`: `form-w-half`, `form-w-third`, `form-w-two-thirds` on a screen from 40rem), and a form can hold a heading (`.form-heading`) and a text (`.form-text`) between its fields; `components/form.twig` draws them. Labels for every control, `aria-describedby` for help and errors, `aria-invalid`, announced status messages, and `autocomplete` hints.
- Social links render only when set in Theme settings (no `#` placeholders).
- Submenus open on hover and focus and close with Escape (focus returns to the parent link); overlays (viewers, the mobile menu) return focus to what opened them.
- Markdown tables are supported and sit in a keyboard-focusable box that scrolls sideways on narrow screens, so no page needs horizontal scrolling at 320 px.
- Blocks without their own heading give their items `<h2>`, so levels never skip.
- `scripts/theme-audit.js` checks pages with axe-core (WCAG 2.2 AA), reflow at 320 px, and the contrast of the theme's colour pairs in all palettes; see the developer guide. It can scan at a phone width and with the phone menu open (`themeAudit.pages(['/'], {width: 375, menu: true})`).
- The phone menu (Theme settings > Header > Phone menu: side drawer from the left or right, full screen, sheet from the top or bottom) is one panel outside the header, so a sticky, blurred, or transparent header never changes how it looks. While it is open the rest of the page is inert, focus stays inside, Escape closes it, and focus returns to the button that opened it. The showcase page `/blocks`, every content page, and the interactive states (mobile menu, viewers, open FAQ) were checked in light and dark.

## Server configuration

Theme assets and image variants go through `public/index.php` when no file exists. Apache needs nothing beyond the shipped `.htaccess`. On nginx every location that serves static files must end in `try_files $uri /index.php?$query_string;` (see `security.md`). For local development pass the router: `php -S 127.0.0.1:8087 -t public public/index.php`.

## Assets

Theme and custom assets live outside `public/` and are served by `ThemeAssets` from `public/index.php` before the application boots. Only static types are served: css, js, map, json, images, and fonts. URLs carry a `?v=` version from the file's mtime and size, and versioned responses are cached for a year. Block stylesheets of a page are served as one bundle (`/_themes/default/_blocks.css?b=hero,faq`).

In templates:

```twig
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ theme_asset('css/site.css') }}">
{% set extra = custom_asset('css/custom.css') %}{# '' when the file does not exist #}
```

## Translations

Strings resolve in this order, later wins:

1. the theme's default-language file
2. the site's overrides for the default language
3. the theme's file for the requested language
4. the site's overrides for the requested language

Admin > Translations saves only the strings that differ from what the theme provides. Resetting a string removes the override, so the theme text (and its future fixes) applies again.

The screen is one language at a time (each language shows how far it is translated; the default language is the source). The strings are grouped by the word before the first dot of their key (`form.error.required` is in *Form*; a key with no dot is in *General*), each with its source text beside the box to type in. A search finds a key or a text, the filters show the strings that are missing, still say what the source language says, or are customized, and a string you add (*Add a string of your own*) is marked as yours and can be deleted. Name keys with an area first (`shop.buy_now`) and the screen keeps them together.

## Backups

Full backups include `custom/`. The restore screen offers it as **Site customizations**.

## Icons

Icons are SVG files in `themes/<theme>/icons/` (and `custom/icons/`, which wins). A field of `type: icon` in `block.yaml` or in the `settings` of `theme.yaml` offers exactly that set, and the admin shows it as a popup of small pictures (`public/assets/js/admin-icons.js`). Use `{{ icon('name') }}` in templates; a name that does not exist prints nothing.
