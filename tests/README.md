# Tests

One command runs everything:

```bash
tests/run.sh          # all checks (about 10 seconds)
tests/run.sh unit     # PHP checks only, no server
tests/run.sh js       # JavaScript checks: editors, branding controls and previews
tests/run.sh http     # the browser-level tests
tests/run.sh redirects   # one HTTP test: editor, roles, import, redirects, save, history, taxonomies, links, delete
```

It needs PHP, Python 3 (standard library only) and, for the JavaScript checks, Node 20 or later; the first run installs the one tool they use (jsdom) into `tests/js/node_modules` from `tests/js/package-lock.json`. Nothing touches your site: the HTTP tests run against a temporary copy of the code on a free local port, seeded from `tests/fixtures/content`, and remove it afterwards. The exit code is non-zero when anything fails, so it can run in CI.

## What is covered

| Check | What it proves |
|---|---|
| `tests/unit/blocks.php` | Block definitions, defaults, tampered values, video links, storage sanitising |
| `tests/unit/revisions.php` | The line diff and the history store: capture, dedupe, outside changes, renames, pruning, deleted items |
| `tests/unit/taxonomies.php` | Term addresses from names, address changes, removals, the layout choices a taxonomy stores |
| `tests/js/serializer.test.js` | The visual editor's serializer (`public/assets/js/admin-editor.js`, the page back to Markdown), the real code run in jsdom over the texts in `tests/js/serializer-samples.js`, drawn by the server's own Markdown code. For each text: opened and left it is written back byte for byte; every block written again reads back as the same page; written twice it does not change. Also the HTML a browser leaves while typing (div, b, nbsp, empty lines), and an edit that must change one block and keep the others. When a text is found that the editor damages, add it to the samples |
| `tests/js/editor-tools.test.js` | The visual editor's toolbar: the whole `admin-editor.js` run in jsdom. The picture dialog and the library it opens (a click in the library must not close the dialog), Insert, and the alignment buttons: one block, a selection over several, left taking the choice away, list items left alone, what is written in the Markdown |
| `tests/unit/branding.php` | Branding CSS and attributes: validated colours and type, optional component tokens, Slate's custom accent background, and no overrides when theme defaults are restored |
| `tests/js/branding-controls.test.js` | Theme/own value indicators, inherited colour swatches without storing overrides, schema-based field and group resets, preset choices kept, and preview refresh after reset |
| `tests/js/branding-preview.test.js` | CSS-only Branding responses, custom CSS precedence, logo removal, mode resets, style samples and return to Site, with Header/Footer HTML previews still accepted |
| `tests/http/branding_test.py` | Branding settings, saving and validation, schema reset data, control placement, style sample markup and access, preview responses storing nothing, and admin frame protection retained |
| `tests/unit/twig-site-functions.php` | The template functions of `PageTwigFunctions` (analytics, SEO, branding) and `GeoTwigFunctions` (maps): present, settings and language read when a function runs and not before, HTML let through only where meant, nothing built for a page with no map |
| `tests/unit/block-runtime.php` | What blocks need from the site (`BlockRuntime`): the registry and the choices it offers (types of content, types with a place, forms), which types can have a place, the maps and their addresses by language, the YouTube services, who is given a kept picture, nothing built before it is asked for |
| `tests/unit/login-controller.php` | The addresses that need no sign-in (`LoginController`): the login screen, a password that is wrong, right, shipped or blocked, signing out (only by the form), signing in with Google at every step it can stop at (state, code, token, profile, domain, no user, switched-off user, success), and the first administrator |
| `tests/unit/html-to-markdown.php` | HTML turned into Markdown: text, lists, tables, embeds, what is dropped, what is reported |
| `tests/unit/wordpress-import.php` | Reading a WordPress site, the plan that changes nothing, writing pages, posts, terms and media, redirects, doing it again, files of the site's own |
| `tests/unit/skill.php` | The skill for other chats (`skills/faroscms`): its snapshot of the blocks, theme settings and ready-made layouts equals the theme's, its references cover every block, its files point to files that exist, and (where Python and PyYAML are present) its scripts validate the demo site and write a page the CMS reads |
| `tests/unit/content-type-catalogue.php` | The types the theme ships, which are on, switching on and off, files kept, pages and forms always on |
| `tests/unit/form-templates.php` | The ready-made forms: each whole (fields survive storing, emails use fields it has), in English, Greek and another language |
| `tests/unit/form-uploads.php` | File fields: size, number, extension and content checks (a PDF named .jpg, text named .pdf, programs, pages and SVG refused, a double extension), the rename pattern (tokens, Greek, collisions, empty fallback, length), the private folder (no way out of it, ZIP, removal with the submission), the email with the files attached or only the links, a real SMTP message with an attachment, and a backup that holds the files and a restore that puts them back |
| `tests/http/form_upload_test.py` | File fields end to end: the form page and its picker, a submit without JavaScript, every refusal writing nothing, no direct address (403 or 404), the admin download and ZIP (and a signed-out user, an editor and a plain user refused), the submissions screens, the CSV, the builder's data and saving, deleting a submission (single and bulk) removing its files |
| `tests/http/form_builder_test.py` | The form builder end to end: the New form screen and its templates, the builder's data, saving and cleaning what it sends, headings and widths on the site, a translation as a copy, an editor kept out |
| `tests/unit/block-containers.php` | Container rows (rows with columns that hold blocks): the settings and their choices, column widths (fill, auto, fraction, percentage, size) and the tampered ones, the shape written to the front matter (only what differs, one to six columns, no container inside a column), the classes and variables of a row and a column, and every reader of `blocks` seeing the blocks in the columns (the Markdown guard, media usage, the link scanner, the editor's migration) |
| `tests/http/block_containers_test.py` | Containers on the page and in the editor: the markup, the classes of every flex setting and breakpoint, the stylesheet carrying the container rules only where there is a container (and the rules of the blocks inside), pages without containers unchanged, a picture with an overlay, nothing for an empty or hidden container, the page text placed once, the editor's data, saving and reading back (also from raw front matter), history, search, feed and the media screen with nested blocks |
| `tests/js/block-containers.test.js` | The builder with containers in jsdom: what is written (blocks without a container come out as they went in), moving blocks by the pointer between columns and in and out of a container, a container refused by a column, the keyboard (Shift and the arrows, what is said, Escape), Wrap in container and Unwrap, presets, adding and removing columns (blocks kept, at most six), no Width for a block in a column, and a save round trip |
| `tests/http/entry_preview_test.py` | The live preview of the content editor end to end: the screen and its toggle, unsaved blocks, text, front matter and new entries drawn through the theme, blocks marked by place (preview only), unreadable YAML answered with an error, nothing written (no file, no history row), signed-out and plain users refused, an editor not getting raw HTML while an administrator does |
| `tests/js/entry-preview.test.js` | The preview's scripts in jsdom: nothing asked while hidden, the 600ms debounce on form input and `bk:change`, the file field left out, an error answer keeping the picture, the remembered open state and width, the arrow keys on the grip, block clicks both ways |
| `tests/http/menu_editor_test.py` | The menu editor end to end: the data it starts with, saving the items, a hidden item, a field that cannot be read, putting a menu in a place, an editor without the right to change settings, deleting |
| `tests/http/catalogue_test.py` | The Content types screen end to end: books off then on, its archive, a book page, the sitemap, an editor kept out |
| `tests/unit/links.php` | Which links to an address are found and rewritten, and which are left alone |
| `tests/unit/content-types.php` | Content type definitions, merging with the site's file, values, ordering |
| `scripts/check-permissions.php` | Every admin action against every role, custom permissions, the capability catalogue |
| `scripts/check-slugs.php` | Greek to Latin addresses, the redirect store, loops, validation |
| `scripts/check-blocks.php` | Every block in the site's own content uses known fields and valid values |
| `tests/http/editor_test.py` | The editor role end to end: what it can reach, raw HTML, forms, dashboard |
| `tests/http/roles_test.py` | Admin > Roles: who can change permissions, tampering, resets, corrupt data |
| `tests/http/import_test.py` | CSV import follows the raw HTML rule |
| `tests/http/save_test.py` | Saving every editor field, compared with recorded files in `tests/fixtures/golden` (`UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 tests/run.sh save` accepts a deliberate change) |
| `tests/http/history_test.py` | What history records, comparing, restoring, deleted items, renames, and who may do what |
| `tests/http/taxonomies_test.py` | Each taxonomy's own layout, title, paging, filters, and content types; term addresses; redirects when an address changes; who may change them |
| `tests/http/links_test.py` | Links to old addresses: the notice after a change, the review screen, updating, chains, other websites, history, permissions |
| `tests/http/delete_test.py` | Deleting with a redirect: the choices, refused targets, drafts, permissions, restore, bulk delete |
| `tests/http/blocks_test.py` | The comparison table and before/after blocks on the showcase page: markup, accessibility attributes, script bundling, the editor |
| `tests/http/custom_roles_test.py` | Making, changing, giving, and deleting roles of your own; what a person with such a role can reach; the limits and tampering |
| `tests/http/storage_test.py` | The storage limit: who can set it, what is stored, the colours at 80% and 90%, the message and contact button, refused uploads, no limit |
| `tests/http/redirects_test.py` | Automatic addresses, address changes, redirects, the not-found list, permissions |

Not covered: real browsers and screen readers, hosting and web server rules, sending email, backups and restores, Google sign-in. See `scripts/theme-audit.js` for the in-browser accessibility scan.

## Adding a test

- **Logic** (PHP): add a `check('what', $actual, $expected)` to a file in `tests/unit/`, or a new file and one line in `run_unit()` of `run.sh`.
- **A screen or a rule**: add checks to a file in `tests/http/`; `client.py` is a tiny cookie-keeping client (`login`, `get`, `submit` a form found on a page). Each test starts from a fresh copy of the fixtures with the default `admin` account. To add a new file, list it in `run_http()` of `run.sh`.
- **When you add an admin action**, add it to the table in `scripts/check-permissions.php`; that is what stops a new screen from being open to the wrong role.
